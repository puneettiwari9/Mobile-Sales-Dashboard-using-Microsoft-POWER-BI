# 📱 Mobile Sales Interactive Dashboard – Power BI Project

Welcome to my Power BI project! This dashboard is a visual analytics tool designed to provide deep insights into mobile sales across different cities, brands, models, and payment methods.

This was built as part of my learning journey through a skills-based Power BI course, where I applied real-world data visualization techniques to build a fully interactive business dashboard.
